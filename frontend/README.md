## UnityAlert Frontend
Welcome to the UnityAlert Frontend repository! UnityAlert is a distributed community alert system designed to enhance public safety by providing real-time alerts during emergencies. Our intuitive web interface ensures that community members can easily subscribe to alerts, manage their preferences, and stay informed when it matters most. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We have used React-Bootstrap components for building the frontend.

## Features
User Registration: Sign up to join the UnityAlert community and customize your alert preferences.
