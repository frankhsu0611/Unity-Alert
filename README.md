**UnityAlert Network
Real-Time Community Safety System Based on the
Publish-Subscribe Model**


In today’s rapidly evolving world, the efficiency of
communication during emergencies has become a critical concern
for communities worldwide. Traditional emergency alert systems,
while effective to a degree, often suffer from limitations in scal-
ability, specificity, and speed, leaving a gap in the community’s
ability to respond promptly to immediate threats. This project
proposes a novel community safety system designed around the
publish-subscribe (pub-sub) model to address these challenges.
Utilizing a distributed network of message brokers, combined
with modern distributed system techniques like gossiping pro-
tocols and concurrency control mechanisms, the system aims to
offer a scalable, reliable, and real-time communication platform.
The proposed UnityAlert Network facilitates the swift dissem-
ination of critical alerts and updates to targeted community
members and safety officials, thus significantly improving public
safety response times. Through the implementation of this system,
communities are not only equipped with a more advanced tool for
emergency response but are also empowered to foster a proactive
safety culture. The report delves into the problem landscape,
the motivation behind the project, a review of existing solutions,
and a detailed account of the proposed solution’s architecture,
algorithms, and expected impact on enhancing community safety
